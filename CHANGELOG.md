  * Clipboard (one item per line)
  * JSON (machine-readable)

* Show media query information in debug information page.
* Enable smart insertion by default.

## 1.0.0 – Initial release

* Three lists:
  * Main list
  * In the cart list
  * Not available list
* Show suggestions as you type.
* Smartly insert items based on how they were marked in the past.
